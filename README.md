# Massah-Meribah Source Criticism

This repository models the literary development of the Massah-Meribah tradition according to the classic Documentary Hypothesis (Jahwist, Elohist, and Priestly sources). The goal is to simulate the process of different source traditions being written and later combined (redacted) into the final form of the Pentateuch. This exercise helps articulate the key distinguishing features of each source's portrayal of the event.

## Narratives Analyzed

1. **Exodus 17:1–7** – attributed to the Jahwist (J) source
2. **Numbers 20:1–13** – attributed to the Priestly (P) source

## Project Structure

- `j-source-notes.md` – analysis of the J account (Exodus 17)
- `p-source-notes.md` – analysis of the P account (Numbers 20)
- `comparison-and-evolution.md` – synthetic essay comparing the two sources and tracing the evolution of the tradition

## Method

The repository uses Git branches and pull requests to simulate the redaction process:
- Separate branches for each source analysis
- Pull requests that “integrate” each source into the main text
- A final comparison file that reflects the combined tradition

## Issues

1. **Analyze and Document the J Source (Exodus 17:1‑7)**
2. **Analyze and Document the P Source (Numbers 20:1‑13)**
3. **Synthesize and Compare the Sources**

These issues track the analytical steps and are referenced in commit messages.
