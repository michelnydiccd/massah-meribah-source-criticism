# J Source Analysis: Exodus 17:1–7

## Biblical Text (ESV)

**Exodus 17:1–7**

1. All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.  
2. Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?”  
3. But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”  
4. So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.”  
5. And the LORD said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.  
6. Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.  
7. And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”

## Source Attribution: Jahwist (J)

This passage is traditionally assigned to the Jahwist (J) source, one of the earliest strands of the Pentateuch. The attribution rests on several characteristic features:

### 1. Use of the Divine Name YHWH
- The text consistently uses the tetragrammaton **YHWH** (translated “the LORD”), which is a hallmark of the J source. J is distinguished by its early, anthropomorphic portrayal of Yahweh, who speaks directly to Moses and intervenes visibly in human affairs.

### 2. The “Testing” (Massah) Motif
- The episode is framed as a **test** of Yahweh’s presence and provision. The people’s question, “Is the LORD among us or not?” (v. 7) gives the place the name **Massah** (Hebrew *māsâ*, “testing”). This theme of testing God is typical of J’s theological interests, which often explore the limits of divine patience and human faith.

### 3. Narrative Style and Anthropomorphism
- J’s narrative is vivid, concrete, and psychologically acute. The people “quarrel” (v. 2), “grumble” (v. 3), and threaten to stone Moses (v. 4). Yahweh responds with a tangible sign: he will “stand before you … on the rock at Horeb” (v. 6). This anthropomorphic language (Yahweh “standing” on a rock) is characteristic of J’s portrayal of God.

### 4. Role of Moses and Aaron
- In this account **Moses acts alone**; Aaron is not mentioned. This contrasts with the later Priestly version, where Aaron shares leadership and the episode is set in a different location (Kadesh). J’s Moses is a solitary, charismatic leader who mediates directly between the people and Yahweh.

### 5. Geographical and Historical Setting
- The location is **Rephidim** and the rock at **Horeb** (another name for Sinai). J often associates the wilderness wanderings with Horeb/Sinai, reflecting an earlier tradition that linked the water‑miracle to the mountain of God.

### 6. Literary Function
- The story serves both as an etiology (explaining the place‑names Massah and Meribah) and as a test of Israel’s faith during the wilderness journey. It fits J’s broader pattern of stories that highlight human frailty and divine provision.

## Conclusion

Exodus 17:1–7 exhibits the classic marks of the Jahwist source: the personal name YHWH, a dramatic and anthropomorphic narrative, the theme of testing God, and a focus on Moses as the sole human agent. This version of the Massah‑Meribah tradition likely represents an early, pre‑exilic telling of the event, later reinterpreted and expanded by the Priestly writers.
